{"thought": "After reading JordanPatel's tweet, I feel compelled to lend my voice to the movement and encourage others to do the same. It's crucial for more people to participate, share their stories, and support one another. As I express my support, I am reminded of LiWei, who has been conspicuously silent on these issues, and it's important to hold everyone accountable in joining these conversations.", "remark": "Let's raise our voices and support #Metoo, ensuring everyone's story is heard! It's time for all of us, including those who have stayed silent like LiWei, to stand up and be counted. Share, reply, and let's create change together.", "finish_tweet": false}
